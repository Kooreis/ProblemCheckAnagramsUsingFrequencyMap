# Question: How do you check if two strings are anagrams using a frequency map? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code checks if two input strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. The code uses a frequency map to solve this problem. The function `buildCharCountMap` is used to create a frequency map for each input string. This function iterates over each character in the input string, converting it to lowercase and ignoring non-alphanumeric characters. It then increments the count of each character in the frequency map. The `areAnagrams` function then compares the frequency maps of the two input strings. If the frequency of any character in the first string's map does not match the frequency in the second string's map, the function returns false, indicating that the strings are not anagrams. If all character frequencies match, the function returns true, indicating that the strings are anagrams.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution uses a class-based approach, which is a feature of TypeScript that allows for better organization and encapsulation of related functions. The JavaScript version, on the other hand, uses a procedural approach with standalone functions.

In the TypeScript version, the `createFrequencyMap` and `areAnagrams` methods are static methods of the `AnagramChecker` class. This means they can be called directly on the class itself, without needing to create an instance of the class.

The TypeScript version also uses the `Map` object to create the frequency map, while the JavaScript version uses a plain object. The `Map` object provides better performance in scenarios involving frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs.

Another difference is that the TypeScript version uses type annotations (`str: string`, `boolean`, `Map<string, number>`), which provide a way to enforce type safety at compile time. This can help catch potential type-related errors before the code is run.

Finally, the TypeScript version includes a check for the size of the frequency maps before comparing the individual characters. This is an optimization that can potentially save time in cases where the two strings are of different lengths, as it would immediately return `false` without needing to compare the individual characters. The JavaScript version does not include this check.

# C++ Differences

The JavaScript and C++ versions of the solution both use a frequency map to solve the problem, but they do it in slightly different ways due to the differences in the languages.

In the JavaScript version, two separate frequency maps are created for each string. The function `buildCharCountMap` is used to create these maps. It iterates over each character in the string, and increments the count of that character in the map. The function `areAnagrams` then compares the two maps. If there is any character that does not have the same count in both maps, it returns false, indicating that the strings are not anagrams.

In the C++ version, only one frequency map is used. The function `areAnagrams` first checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns false. Then it iterates over each character in both strings at the same time. For each character in the first string, it increments the count in the map, and for each character in the second string, it decrements the count. If the strings are anagrams, all counts in the map should be zero at the end. If there is any count that is not zero, it returns false.

The C++ version uses the `unordered_map` data structure from the Standard Library, which is similar to JavaScript's object used as a map. The C++ version also uses the range-based for loop to iterate over the map, which is similar to the for-in loop in JavaScript.

The C++ version does not handle case sensitivity or non-alphabetic characters, unlike the JavaScript version which converts all characters to lower case and removes non-alphabetic characters. This could be added to the C++ version with additional code.

In terms of input, the JavaScript version tests the function with hard-coded strings, while the C++ version prompts the user to enter the strings.
